In this project I was learning and experiment with different things. Following a tutorial,
I tried my hand at building a "facsimile of a residential neighborhood".

Skills like: 
- mathematics
- algorithms 
- programming 
- design

* Building a spatial graph from scratch and creating an editor with a dynamic viewport.
* Understanding the mathematics and logic behind user-friendly interfaces.
* Generating road borders, buildings, and trees using geometry and creating a 3D effect but (2d).
* Implementing road markings to prepare for advanced self-driving challenges. (Improve)

In progress and Improve project.
Final result into screenshot number two
